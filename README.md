Wanjee.be
=========

Shuwee is a backend administration application (yes, one more) for your websites or RESTFUL apps.  It is made from several Symfony bundles.

Features will include:

- CRUD capabilities
- Nice backend interface
- REST API
- And much more

Wanjee.be is my personal website which I also use as a playground and demo for the development of Shuwee bundles.

Why "Shuwee" ?
